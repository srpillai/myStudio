# Studio 4: Restaurant Menu, Continued
Solution for Studio 4 in [Java Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/java-web-development/chapters/classes/studio.html)

## Notes
While this studio is very subjective, we hope that providing you with an example of how this may appear at the end of the class period is helpful.

## Diagram

Students are asked to draw what the ``Menu`` and ``MenuItem`` classes with instance methods should look like before they start coding.
Ultimately, the most important thing is to ask questions about why students chose specific acccess modifiers and talk about object-oriented programming.
These decisions should be guided by best practices, but there is not necessarily a right and wrong answer.

## Example

After students finish their diagrams, they can start coding their classes. The solution code in this repo is based on this example diagram:
